# wsl-scripts
These scripts are a complete set of actions needed to start docker with WSL on windows. 
It follows the actions described in this article https://dev.to/bowmanjd/install-docker-on-windows-wsl-without-docker-desktop-34m9
There are some additional sctips to solve particular problems which are not described in the article.

Windows "run with admin rights" feature appart and I would have been able to create just one script and run it in a single shot. 

After runing these scripts you will be able to run docker and docker-compose on your machine.

Legend:
#For some it may sound redundant but I also forget this stuff if not using for a long period:
##Scripts ending with GitBash should be run on GitBash
##Scripts ending with Admin should be run with admin rights. 
##Scripts ending with WSL should be run withing WSL linux.
##Scripts ending with Powershell should be run in Powershell.
